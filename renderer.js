   OPEN MIAMI — WebGL renderer.

   The Rust/wasm engine owns the simulation and describes each frame as a
   flat Float32Array command stream (plus a \x1f-separated text arena),
   handed over once per frame through window.frameRender. This module owns
   the canvas and the GPU: it executes the stream with a single batched
   triangle pipeline.

   Command opcodes — mirror of `mod op` in src/graphics.rs. Keep in sync.

   Everything is drawn as vertex-colored, textured triangles in one
   interleaved dynamic buffer (a 1x1 white texture stands in for solid
   geometry), so a frame typically costs a handful of draw calls: the batch
   only breaks when the bound texture changes (solids -> robot atlas ->
   solids -> glyph atlas -> shoggoth atlas).

   Text: VT323 ("GameFont") glyphs are rasterized lazily into a glyph-atlas
   texture via a scratch 2D canvas, then drawn as quads like everything
   else.

   Robots: true live 3D->2D, every frame, at continuous animation time. Each
   ROBOT command reserves a tile in a per-frame scratch atlas and queues a
   robot-core render. The queued robots run as ONE BATCH inside this same GL
   context right before the batch that samples them is drawn (robot-core's
   batchBegin / batchDraw / batchEnd): pass 1 draws every robot's lit boxes
   into its own tile viewport of a single 1024² scene target (one clear), and
   pass 2 is ONE tile-aware edge-ink / posterize / pixelate draw over all the
   tiles into the atlas, AT BLOCK RESOLUTION (ROBOT_ART = ceil(128 / 3) = 43
   NEAREST texels per robot — one per pixelate block, the exact image a 1:1
   post pass gives, without the 9 redundant copies of each block). So N robots
   cost N tiny scene draws + one post draw + N textured quads, with no tile
   cache, no quantization of the animation and no CPU readback.

   Shoggoth (the boss): the same mechanism through shoggoth-core.js — a SHOGGOTH
   command reserves a bigger tile in its own scratch atlas and queues a live
   render of the mass / mask / tentacles at (heading, reveal, time); the tile is
   drawn as an axis-aligned quad through the transform stack (its facing is
   baked into the render itself, not a quad rotation).

   POSTFX: when a frame's stream contains opcode 14 (found by a cheap pre-scan
   over the opcode table), the whole frame is rendered into an offscreen scene
   framebuffer instead of the canvas, then drawn through a full-screen post
   shader. The kinds are a menu of Hotline-Miami-flavoured looks:
     0 BLUR-OUT      growing multi-tap blur + dissolve toward the colour (the ending)
     1 SYNTHWAVE CRT scanlines, chromatic split, vignette, grain (the credits)
     2 VHS TAPE      tracking band, per-line jitter, chroma bleed, dropouts
     3 DRUNK SWAY    slow rotation/zoom breathing, wavy warp, ghosting, hue drift
     4 CRT TUBE      barrel distortion, aperture grille, hard scanlines, flicker
     5 ACID TRIP     radial hue cycling, oversaturation, posterize, liquid warp
     6 DATAMOSH      slice/block displacement glitch, channel swaps, noise blocks
     7 NEON BLOOM    bright-pass glow, shadow tint toward the colour
     8 PIXEL MOSAIC  chunky pixelation + dithered posterize
     9 TUNNEL RUSH   radial zoom blur toward the centre (adrenaline)
    10 WARP TRAILS   FEEDBACK: a persistent ping-pong accumulator is pulled
                     toward the centre each frame (so its content streams
                     OUTWARD), faded, and re-fed the scene's bright saturated
                     pixels — long-exposure radial light trails (the ending
                     elevator ride); the colour tints the trail decay. The
                     accumulator is cleared whenever the previous frame did
                     not use kind 10, so the effect always starts clean.
   All kinds share the args `kind t r g b` (t = 0..1 strength, rgb = the
   effect's colour where it uses one). Only the last POSTFX of a frame applies.

   PIXEL-ART GROUPS (opcodes 15/16): the clean way to pixelate primitive-drawn
   content is not to average or point-sample a hi-res image but to RASTERIZE
   AT THE ART RESOLUTION and upscale nearest. PIX_BEGIN `px w h` flushes,
   points the batch at a scratch framebuffer (a region of ceil(w/px) x
   ceil(h/px) texels of a 1024x1024 NEAREST-filtered texture, cleared
   transparent) and installs the transform scale(1/px), so the group's local
   0..w x 0..h maps onto those texels; everything until PIX_END is drawn there
   with hard coverage (FBOs carry no MSAA; the batch shader has no smoothing),
   so a shape's edge either owns a texel or it does not — every art pixel is a
   full pixel and the grid is anchored to the object. Inside a group line /
   outline thickness is clamped to >= 1 texel and circle radius to >= 0.5
   texel so hairlines survive. PIX_END `x y` flushes, restores the outer
   target + transform, and draws the group texture as a (w, h) quad at (x, y)
   in the outer transform (through it: a rotation in force at PIX_BEGIN
   rotates the finished pixel image), origin snapped to whole pixels of the
   target it lands in. Groups NEST up to PIX_DEPTH (4) deep: each depth owns
   its own scratch texture + FBO, an inner PIX_END composites its texels into
   the enclosing group's target (premultiplied, NEAREST), whose grid the
   origin snaps to. A group over the 1024-texel cap or beyond the depth cap
   is drawn pass-through (no pixelation; its PIX_END is a no-op). Robots /
   the boss can be drawn inside a group (their tiles composite into the
   group's texels). Inside a group primitives obey the PIXEL-ART RULE at
   rasterization time (see solidRect / circle / line): axis-aligned rects
   get a whole-texel size (rounded once, min 1) and a whole-texel origin,
   circles of radius <= 2 texels a half-texel radius and a grid-snapped
   centre (texel centre for odd diameters, corner for even), lines a
   whole-texel thickness and texel-centre endpoints — so a moving shape keeps
   one constant stamp and hops texel by texel. Circles are always tessellated
   in target space (fixed polygon phase), so a circle under a rotating
   transform (a fan's well / hub) never changes its rasterization.

     Frame-invariant world geometry (the floor tiles + walls) baked ONCE into
     a persistent VBO and re-drawn every later frame for a 2-float STATIC_REF
     — instead of ~2000 floats re-recorded and re-tessellated per frame (the
     bulk of the `walk` span). STATIC_BEGIN `key` flushes and starts routing
     every tessellated vertex into a growable side buffer, with the transform
     in force at the BEGIN (the camera) REPLACED by identity — so the
     vertices come out in WORLD coordinates, while the section's own
     save/translate/... still apply. STATIC_END uploads the buffer to a
     persistent VBO under `key` (gl.bufferData STATIC_DRAW, once; a
     different key's old buffer is deleted — one live key, the current
     floor), restores the camera transform and draws the cache. STATIC_REF
     `key` just draws it: the CPU-side transform at that point (the camera,
     which moves/zooms/sways every frame) is handed to the batch vertex
     shader as the uXA/uXB affine uniform, applied on the GPU — identical
     math to the CPU path, so the cache tracks the camera exactly; dynamic
     draws keep uXA/uXB at identity. The section must be SOLID geometry only
     (everything samples whiteTex): text or sprites inside would bake with
     the wrong texture. Works inside a pixel group too (the `?pixel=N`
     world): there `m` is the group's world->texel mapping — still affine —
     and the batch target is the group's scratch region, so the same VBO
     draws into the group's texels; one buffer serves both modes. */
