# See https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html for all lints

# Warn on more pedantic issues
# Uncomment to enable stricter linting:
# avoid-breaking-exported-api = true

# Cognitive complexity threshold
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Too many arguments threshold
too-many-arguments-threshold = 8

# Type complexity threshold
type-complexity-threshold = 250

# Single char binding threshold

# Disallowed methods (methods you want to prevent usage of)
# disallowed-methods = []

# Disallowed types
# disallowed-types = []

# Allowed scripts for identifiers (default allows most Unicode)
# allowed-scripts = ["Latin"]

# Maximum cognitive complexity for tests
