# Floor & scenario format

One JSON file per floor in `levels/floor_NN.json` (NN = 00..13 — `floor_00.json` is
the ground-level cold open: the main gate / parking lot — and `floor_13h.json` for
FLOOR 13½). `levels/index.json` lists them in play order. This JSON is the single
source of truth: the **native level editor** (`/?viz` → LEVELS, `src/editor.rs` +
`src/editor_ui.rs`: walls, rooms, zones, spawns, pickups, entry / exits, placed props) and
the **web scenario editor** (`tools/levels.html`, its SCENARIO (web) button: steps and
dialogue) read/write it, and `tools/gen_levels.py` (Python stdlib only — no crates)
generates `src/levels_data.rs` (checked in) which the Rust engine compiles as static data.
Both editors write the same formatting (2-space indent, small objects inlined up to 100
columns, the key order below), so a floor saved untouched by either is byte-identical.

World units: the existing levels are ~1000×800 world units; keep that scale
(1 unit = 1 px at zoom 1). Origin top-left, +y down.

## Triggers (`trigger.kind`)
| kind | fields | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | — | the floor starts |
| `enter_zone` | `zone`, optional `before` (step id) | the player is inside that zone — with `before`, only while step `before` has **not** fired yet (once it fires the step is disarmed forever; for scene beats that stop making sense past a point, like floor 1's "not past the line" block before the desk scene) |
| `kills` | `count` | at least `count` rogues are dead on this floor |
| `all_dead` | — | every rogue (incl. spawned waves) is dead, and at least one has died — un-alerted civilians are not rogues, so a floor whose hostiles have not shown up yet is not "cleared" |
| `timer` | `seconds`, optional `after` (step id) | `seconds` after floor start (or after step `after` fired — but when step `after` has `talk` actions, `seconds` counts from the moment its **conversation ends** (last line dismissed, panel gone), since the player paces it) |
| `exit_open` | optional `exit` | that exit (any if omitted) has been opened |
| `step_done` | `step` | step `step` has fired (chain steps) |
| `boss_dead` | — | the floor's boss (the `Boss` entity) is dead — never on floors without one |
| `extracted` | — | the player has extracted (stood the full dwell in an open exit); the scenario keeps ticking through the completion card / the 13½ epilogue, so this is how a floor talks *after* the ride starts |

Within one tick, `kills` / `all_dead` are evaluated after the other triggers and the
rogue counts are recomputed after every fired step, so a `spawn` in the same tick can
never let `all_dead` slip through.

## Actions
| action | payload | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `say` | `who`, `text`, optional `delay` (s, default 0; relative to the step firing) | queue a comms line; lines with delays play **one after another** |
| `talk` | `who`, `text` (no `delay` — the player paces it) | queue a **DIALOGUE line**: consecutive `talk` actions in one step (and same-tick steps) form ONE conversation, shown in the visual-novel panel that slides in from the right (the speaking bot's bust, name in the speaker's colour, typewriter text). While it is up the player is locked like a `hold` (the world keeps running) and click / Space / Enter advances: first press reveals the typing line, next press moves on; after the last line the panel slides out and control returns. A `timer` trigger `after` the step counts from the conversation's end |
| `spawn` | array of spawns | spawn a wave (counted by `kills`/`all_dead`) |
| `open_exit` / `close_exit` | exit id | open/close an elevator (open = extractable) |
| `objective` | text | replace the on-screen objective line |
| `sfx` | name (`elevator`, `mask_crack`, `level_clear`, ...) | play a one-shot |
| `alert` | `"all"` \| `{ "zone": id }` \| `{ "group": id }` | flip the matching passive bots hostile toward the player (all of them / the ones standing inside that zone / the ones spawned with that `group`) |
| `hold` | `{ "seconds": s, "text": "…" }` or `{ "until_comms_idle": true, "seconds": cap, "text": "…" }` | lock the player's movement / fire / throw / pickup for `s` seconds (the world keeps running, comms keep playing; Esc still pauses); `until_comms_idle` releases as soon as the comms feed has nothing queued or typing, capped at `seconds` (default and hard cap 20 s). Optional `text` = a dim centred caption ("SCANNING…") |
| `look_at` | `{ "x", "y", "seconds" }` | ease the camera focus onto that world point (smoothstep in over 0.6 s), hold, ease back onto the player over the last 0.6 s; total `seconds` |
| `gate` | `{ "input": kind, "text": "LEFT CLICK — PUNCH" }` | **TUTORIAL GATE**: the world FREEZES (enemies, enemy attacks, the boss, projectiles-at-rest, the scenario clock — timers do **not** advance) and a centred lower-third prompt shows `text` (the part before the ` — ` separator is highlighted in the accent colour). The player can still aim, turn and MOVE (to close distance), but every combat input except the gated one is masked; their own bullets / thrown weapons keep flying, knockdown clocks play their fall but never expire, and the finisher animation runs. The gate releases only when the gated action **succeeds**: `punch` = an unarmed strike connects, `finish` = a finisher completes, `pickup` = E picks a weapon up, `strike` = an armed melee hit connects, `fire` = a gun round leaves, `throw` = a thrown weapon connects. On release the step's actions **after** the gate run (so gates chain inside one step), and the step only counts as done for `step_done` / `timer.after` from that moment. One gate at a time (the frozen scenario can't fire another step under it). Design the floor so a target always exists (spawn it in the same step, before the gate); with `?debug` + overlays on, **G** skips the active gate. While a gate holds, the MUSIC stops (back on release) and the player is tethered by invisible walls within ~180 u of the gate's target (the step's last `spawn`, or the nearest downed bot for `finish`; `pickup` gates roam free). During `strike` / `fire` / `throw` / `pickup` gates the E key stays live as a recovery path (fetch the right weapon back); the left click only acts when the held weapon matches the gate (no stray gunshot can kill a `strike` gate's target) |
| `checkpoint` | `true` | snapshot the RUN mid-floor: the whole world (player position / health / held weapon + ammo, every entity alive-or-corpse and where, dropped pickups, exit open/closed states, RNG) plus the scenario (fired steps, objective, comms). On death, **R** restores the latest snapshot of the floor instead of restarting it from scratch (the death flash / sfx still play). No checkpoint fired = the old full-restart behaviour. Snapshots are taken at the end of the tick the action ran in, so a `spawn` / `alert` in the same step is inside the snapshot |
| `combat` | `true` \| `false` | enable / disable the player's fighting (fire, throw, punch, finisher); walking, aiming and E stay live. Default on, resets each floor; tutorial `gate`s bypass it. Floor 0's lot runs with it off |
| `disarm` | `true` | take the player's held weapon away (it vanishes — the checkpoint desk keeps it; used to guarantee the tutorial's `punch` gate starts bare-fisted) |

## Passive bots (`"type": "passive"`)
A civilian: no vision cone, never aggroes, never attacks, unarmed. Fields:
- `look`: `idle` \| `wandering` (default) \| `patrolling` — the palette / and the hostile it becomes.
- `walk_to`: a zone id — it strolls (pathfinding, ~55% of chase speed) to a random point inside
  that zone, then stands there fidgeting; without it, it drifts gently around its spawn point.
- `face`: heading in degrees (0 = +x, -90 = up) to settle on once there.
- `group`: an id the `alert` action can address (`{ "group": id }`).
It collides / gets knocked back / takes damage like a rogue and **counts** as a rogue for
`kills` / `all_dead`. Any passive taking damage flips **every** passive on the floor hostile;
`alert` flips them selectively. A flipped bot becomes a hostile of its `look` type that already
knows where the player is, and arms itself with that type's weapon.

Speakers and their colours are fixed: `CL4-UD3` (coral, terse), `HUNTER` (magenta),
`SENTINEL` (red), `DRIFTER` (violet, glitchy), `SWARM` (magenta chorus), `CORRUPTOR`
(yellow, the shoggoth's voice bleeding through), `UPLINK` (pale mint — the thread home,
calm and aligned; only heard once the uplink is restored after 13½).

## Props (`props[]`)
Placed props are **decoration only**: they are drawn on the floor over the tiles and
walls and under the actors, animated by the game clock, and have **no collision** —
walls still block, props do not (phase 1). Each placement is
`{ "kind", "x", "y", "rot", "size" }`:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | a prop id — the `snake_case` of a `PROP_NAMES` display name in `src/props.rs` (`rack_closed`, `crac_cooler`, `reception_desk`, `car_pod`, …; `gen_levels.py` rejects unknown kinds) |
| `x`, `y` | the prop's centre, world units |
| `rot` | rotation in degrees, clockwise (+y down); default `0` |
| `size` | the prop's box in world units — `100` = its design size; default `100` |

A prop is drawn with its own saved pixel-art settings (`props/props.json`,
`docs/PROPS_FORMAT.md`), so a placement is only *where / how big / which way*. The key
is optional: floors without props omit it (the writers keep it out when the list is
empty).

## Rules
- The player **extracts** by standing inside an **open** exit elevator for ~0.6 s → floor
  complete → next floor = that exit's `to`. Kill-all is no longer the win condition.
- Backward compatibility: a floor with **no** scenario step that opens an exit behaves
  like `all_dead → open all exits`.
- Floor 0 (`floor_00.json`, GATE / PARKING) is the cold open: arrive through the main
  gate (`entry.kind: "gate"`) among passive bots, cross the asphalt lot to the welcome
  hall's `door` exit → floor 1, the lobby.
- Floor 13's exit leads to `14` (13½): the elevator jams → boss intro → boss fight.
- An exit with `"to": "surface"` ends the run: EXFILTRATE card → the `extracted`
  epilogue comms play until the feed goes idle → blur-out → credits. (The generator maps
  it to `scenario::SURFACE_EXIT`; `0` is a real floor now.)
- The `?floor=N` URL param starts the game directly on floor id N (0 = the gate, 14 =
  13½; for the editor's “play” button and for testing).
