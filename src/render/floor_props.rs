//! Placed floor props (`FloorDef::props`, `levels/*.json` → `props`): drawn
//! in WORLD space over the floor tiles and walls, under the actors, with the
//! prop's own saved pixel-art settings (`props/props.json`), rotated by the
//! placement's `rot`. Decoration only — no collision (phase 1). Shared by
//! the game (`update_game`) and the native level editor.
